        <h2>Eggs are a staple breakfast food in many cultures. Here's how to a make a damn good one.</h2>
        
        <p>Of all the ways to cook eggs, frying is perhaps the simplest and arguably the tastiest. Whether your preference is a soft, medium, or hard yolk, the method is almost identical.</p>
        <p>Frying an egg may seem simple but there are a few things that can go wrong to ruin the experience. Trial and error will be your best guide and finding what works for your cookware and preference will take time and the occassional messy breakfast.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1-2 eggs.</li>
                <li>Salt.</li>
                <li>Pepper.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat a non-stick frying pan or skillet to low/medium heat. A cool pan will result in a rubbery egg, a pan that is too hot will sear or burn the edges and is not especially healthy.</li>
                <li>When the pan is hot, add a pat of bacon fat to coat, than a small pat of butter to coat. These layers will work in tandem to ensure your egg(s) won't stick.</li>
                <li>Crack your egg(s) on the center of the pan. You should hear a nice sizzle. If you see the edges start to turn brown or stick, the pan is too hot.</li>
                <li>Once you see the whites fully set, carefully work around the edges of the egg(s) and then flip.</li>
                <li>After about 20 seconds, you have an egg over easy. A little longer for medium. And another minute, over hard. An easy way to judge the yolk is to give the pan a little jiggle or very carefully press on the yolk.</li>
                <li>Lightly salt and pepper the egg(s) and serve with warm buttered toast, your breakfast meat of choice, and a hot coffee.</li>
            </ol>
