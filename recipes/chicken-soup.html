        <h2>A cold weather favorite, a simple, hot bowl of chicken soup is always a people pleaser.</h2>
        
        <p>A hot bowl of soup that doesn't require many ingredients or a whole afternoon to prepare. This recipe will serve about 4 and pairs well with a side of fresh bread.</p>
        <p>At a minimum, this recipe requires chicken (ideally thighs), white onion, one or two other vegetables and salt. You can get fancy and add noodles and a mountain of veggies, but they're definitely not necessary.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>About 1lb of chicken thighs, most any cut will work, but the fattier, darker meat is ideal.</li>
                <li>Half of a large onion, or a whole small one.</li>
                <li>1 chopped stalk of celery.</li>
                <li>1 chopped carrot.</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Pepper</li>
                <li>Optional: 1 potato.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill a large pot half way with water and bring to a boil.</li>
                <li>As the water is warming, chop the onions, celery, and carrots and set aside.</li>
                <li>Place the chicken thighs whole into the water. The water does not need to yet be boiling and the chicken can even be frozen, just make sure to seperate any pieces that are stuck together as soon as they allow.</li>
                <li>After the (thawed) chicken has boiled for 20 minutes, remove the chicken from the pot and add the veggies and salt and pepper to taste. Don't be stingy with the salt.</li>
                <li>Chop the chicken into bite sized pieces and return to the pot.</li>
                <li>Optional: Add a chopped potato, but only at the last 20 minutes of cook time to prevent them from disintegrating.</li>
                <li>Let simmer for 20-30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Serve with warm, buttered bread and/or side salad.</li>
          </ol>
