        <h2>A wonderful dish any time of year, pork cutlet likely pairs with your preferred sides from most cultural dishes throughout the world.</h2>
        
        <p>This recipe calls for off-the-shelf bread crumbs, eggs, and fresh pork cutlet. Spruce it up with your spices of choice, though adding salt and pepper is most effective. Preparing the ingredients while the pan preheats, you can expect to fry 4 cutlets in about 20-30 minutes with a sufficiently sized pan.</p>
        <p>Pan frying on medium heat ensures the pork will cook throughout without burning the breading. Don't be discouraged if it takes a few failed attemepts until you find the right cooking temperature, once you get it, <em>it's worth it!</em>. Using the most non-stick pan you have on hand and a heavier cooking medium such as bacon fat will ensure the breading doesn't stick to the pan.</p>
